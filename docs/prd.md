# Taskfile IntelliJ Plugin - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Taskfile IntelliJ Plugin provides seamless integration between [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/) and JetBrains IDEs. It displays Taskfile tasks in a dedicated tool window panel, similar to existing task runners (Maven, Gradle, npm), enabling developers to discover, execute, and manage tasks directly from their IDE.

## Problem Statement

Developers using Taskfile for task automation currently lack IDE integration, forcing them to:
- Switch between IDE and terminal to run tasks
- Manually remember task names and descriptions
- Navigate complex directory structures to find relevant taskfiles
- Miss the productivity benefits of integrated task runners available for other build tools

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Provide native Taskfile integration in JetBrains IDEs
- Match the user experience of existing task runner integrations
- Enable task discovery and execution without leaving the IDE

### Success Metrics
- Reduce context switching between IDE and terminal
- Improve task discoverability in multi-taskfile projects
- Increase developer productivity with Taskfile-based workflows

## Target Users

**Primary**: Software developers using JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.) who use Taskfile for task automation

**Secondary**: Development teams standardizing on Taskfile for build/deployment workflows

## Feature Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Taskfile Discovery & Parsing
**Priority**: P0
- Automatically scan project for Taskfile files (`Taskfile.yml`, `Taskfile.yaml`, `taskfile.yml`, `taskfile.yaml`)
- Support nested taskfiles in subdirectories
- Parse YAML structure to extract:
  - Task names
  - Task descriptions (`desc` field)
  - Task dependencies (`deps` field)
  - Task commands (`cmds` field)
- Handle malformed YAML gracefully with error logging

#### 2. Tool Window Panel
**Priority**: P0
- Create dedicated "Taskfile" tool window
- Position panel on right side by default (configurable)
- Display hierarchical tree structure:
  - Root: Taskfile locations
  - Children: Individual tasks with descriptions
- Support expand/collapse operations
- Show relative paths for nested taskfiles

#### 3. Task Execution
**Priority**: P0
- Double-click task to execute
- Create IntelliJ Run Configurations for tasks
- Execute tasks in correct working directory
- Display output in integrated console
- Support task cancellation
- Handle task dependencies automatically via `task` CLI

#### 4. User Interface
**Priority**: P0
- Tree view with icons:
  - ðŸ“„ Taskfile icons
  - ðŸŽ¯ Task icons
- Task display format: `{name} - {description}` or `{name}` if no description
- Right-click context menus:
  - "Run Task"
  - "Open Taskfile"
  - "Show Dependencies" (if applicable)
- Toolbar with actions:
  - Refresh tasks
  - Expand all
  - Collapse all
- Built-in search functionality

### Enhanced Features

#### 5. Settings & Configuration
**Priority**: P1
- Configure taskfile names to search for
- Set custom `task` executable path
- Add/remove taskfile name patterns
- Preferences panel under Tools settings

#### 6. Auto-refresh
**Priority**: P1
- Monitor taskfile changes via VFS listeners
- Automatically refresh tree when taskfiles are modified
- Debounce refresh operations to avoid excessive updates

#### 7. Integration Features
**Priority**: P2
- Integration with IntelliJ's run configuration system
- Support for run configuration templates
- Task dependency visualization
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- IntelliJ Platform SDK
- YAML plugin (`org.jetbrains.plugins.yaml`)
- SnakeYAML library for YAML parsing
- `task` CLI tool installed on system

### Compatibility
- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2+
- All JetBrains IDEs built on IntelliJ Platform
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Performance
- Fast taskfile scanning (< 500ms for typical projects)
- Responsive UI operations
- Memory efficient tree model
- Lazy loading for large projects

## User Experience

### User Journey: Discovering Tasks
1. Developer opens project with Taskfile
2. Plugin automatically detects taskfiles
3. "Taskfile" panel appears in tool window
4. Developer sees organized tree of available tasks
5. Task descriptions provide context without opening files

### User Journey: Running Tasks
1. Developer locates desired task in tree
2. Double-clicks task or uses context menu
3. Task executes with output in integrated console
4. Developer can monitor progress and cancel if needed
5. Task completion status visible in run tool window

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when `task` CLI not found
- Clear error messages for malformed taskfiles
- Fallback behavior when YAML parsing fails
- User-friendly notifications for common issues

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
- Taskfile discovery and parsing
- Basic tree view
- Task execution via double-click
- Simple toolbar actions

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX
- Context menus
- Settings panel
- Auto-refresh functionality
- Better error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Run configuration integration
- Dependency visualization
- Performance optimizations
- Additional customization options

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **YAML parsing complexity**: Mitigated by using established SnakeYAML library
- **Cross-platform task execution**: Handled by IntelliJ's process management APIs
- **Performance with large projects**: Addressed through lazy loading and efficient scanning

### User Adoption Risks
- **Discoverability**: Mitigated by following IntelliJ UI patterns
- **Learning curve**: Minimized by matching existing task runner interfaces

## Success Criteria

### Launch Criteria
- Successful taskfile detection in 95% of valid projects
- Task execution works reliably across platforms
- UI responsive with projects containing 50+ tasks
- Zero critical bugs in core functionality

### Post-Launch Metrics
- Plugin adoption rate in Taskfile community
- User satisfaction scores
- Feature usage analytics
- Support ticket volume

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Task templates and scaffolding
- Integration with project templates
- Task scheduling and automation
- Multi-project task orchestration
- Custom task icons and categorization

### Ecosystem Integration
- GitHub Actions integration
- Docker Compose task support
- CI/CD pipeline visualization
- Team collaboration features
